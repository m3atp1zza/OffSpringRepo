If you changed account information in the [B]"My Accounts"[/B] addon outside of PoisonIvy you need to
sync the new account information back to PoisonIvy with the [B]"sync(re) with My Accounts"[/B] option.
If you made changed via the [B]"Open My Accounts Addon"[/B] here in PoisonIvy's settings, or PoisonIvy's
UI, then this process is done for you.  A visible notification will alert you of the auto sync process.
